2. [PCI passthrough via OVMF](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF)
3. [VGAPassthrough](https://wiki.debian.org/VGAPassthrough)
4. [HOW-TO make dual-boot obsolete using kvm VGA passthrough](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=231&t=212692&sid=e446a11cb6bc36c4b5e6d4a04efb8703)
