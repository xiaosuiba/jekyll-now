title: Shade Issue With Openstack Newton
---
Recently, I'm trying to create a installation tool to deploy openstack newton automatically. Ansible has a great support for openstack, the cloud module. With ansible I can create openstack users, projects easily with building module instead of shell scripts. All I need is to install shade python package in both controller and the node to be controlled.

However, this time I ran into a big trouble. After install shade with pip:

```
pip install shade
```

Then I found the openstack client has been damaged!!  When I execute `openstack user list`, I got this error:

```
__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'app_name'
```

After hours of debugging and googling, I found the reason why it happened. When I installed shade through pip, it update a bunch of other libraries which are not in the dependencies list of shade in the pip official site.

```bash

    DEPRECATION: Uninstalling a distutils installed project (pyparsing) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. This is due to the fact that uninstalling a distutils project will only partially uninstall the project.

```

I try to recover the issue by reinstall those python packages changed by shade and find out it's the very package **cliff** that brings the issue.

I found two workarounds:

1. update python-openstackclient through pip.
2. install shade and its essensial dependencies with â€”no-deps arg through pip.

As it's best to keep those packages intalled from yum repository,  it's always better to choose the 2nd way.
